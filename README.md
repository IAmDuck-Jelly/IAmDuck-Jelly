## The Duck's Jellylike Skill-Swap 🐣🫧

#About Me 🦆
  
  As IAmDuck-Jelly, I'm a jack-of-all-trades with a passion for learning and experimenting with new skills - but not necessarily trying to excel at any one thing. Instead, I'm always looking for ways to add new tools to my skillset and combine them to tackle different tasks which is why there's "Jelly" in my name - soft, adaptable, and able to take on many shapes and forms.

#My Philosophy 🛠

  I believe that having a wide range of skills can be incredibly powerful. By being able to dabble in many areas, I can approach problems from different angles and find creative solutions. I'm always looking for ways to improve my skills and expand my knowledge, and I'm excited to share my journey with you.

#Stay Quacky - Bye 😶‍🌫️ 🫥
